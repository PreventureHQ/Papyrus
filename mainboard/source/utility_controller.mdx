## Resumable file uploads

Supply a name for the file to be uploaded and Preventure.live will return a corresponding upload url.

A resumeable upload allows you to resume data transfer operations after a communication failure
has interrupted the flow of data. Resumeable uploads work by sending multiple requests, each of
which contains the portion of the data being uploaded. This is different from a simple upload,
which contains all of the object's data in a single request and must be restrated from the begining
if it fails part way through. Use a resumebale upload if you are uploading large files or uploading
over a slow connection.
